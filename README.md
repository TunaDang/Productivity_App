# TodOCaml
A todo list implemented in Ocaml. Cornell CS 3110 final project.

## Description
A terminal-based productivity application that utilizes ASCII art to display your goals in a user-friendly and fun way. The most complex component will be parsing through the user-inputted task and having the option to use NLP to extract the key task elements, and then updating the calendar based on the processed task. NLP may not be required depending on if the user inputs their task in a certain format.
